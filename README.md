A simple javascript 2D game engine.

Current list of features:
 * Multiple scenes/levels
 * Each level with its own hierarchy of items on screen
 * Item positioning and rotation inside the hierarchy
 * Independent background collection attached to the scene (with parallax)
 * Image preloading
 * GUI elements (text, console, menus, windows/frames)
 * Css fonts rendering to images (only re-rendered when text changes)
 * Simple item behaviour attaching it to a tracker (bezier curves, circles, sine movement, follow)
 * Particle system
 * Input controller per scene (single keys and key combos: consecutive or simultaneous keys)
 * Clock subcriptions to wait for certain events
 * Bla, bla, bla... 
 
To do:
 * Sound
 * Item colections in the scene (multiple layers of items)
 * Upload some examples of how to use the engine
 * Bla, bla, bla...

I started this just to learn something about javascript, so...
 * Is the code orthodox? Maybe not, as I'm not used to most javascript coding conventions. Feel free to point anything you found or to improve it.
 * Did I learn a lot? Sure I did.
 * Does it work? Yes it does.
